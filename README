This project is intended to provide and maintain an RPM package for
version 4 of the Allegro game programming library. It is a WIP for now and
doesn't actually work yet. :) There may also be other efforts to do this
too (update 'allegro' in Fedora to 4.4.x), in which case this project will
probably be promptly rm -fR'd. ;)

== The RPM ==

The way that I'm currently organizing this:

Use rpmdev-setuptree to create your ~/rpm tree if you haven't already:

  $ rpmdev-setuptree

This should leave you with the following directories in ~/rpm:

BUILD
RPMS
SOURCES
SPECS
SRPMS

Clone this repository to where ever you wish to work on it. I've
personally got the Allegro source checked out into
~/src/allegro/${version}, so I've created this repository right next to
that: ~/src/allegro/rpm.

Then, create an absolute path symbolic link from any .spec files in the
repository to the SPECS directory of your ~/rpm:

  $ for f in ~/src/allegro/rpm/*.spec; do
      ln -s $f ~/rpm/SPECS/$(basename $f);
    done

Download the source tarball for Allegro and stick it in the ~/rpm/SOURCES
directory.

Or, just execute the included init.sh script, which will do all
of these things for you. I've tried to make it as smart and safe as
possible, but it might still do "damage" so USE AT OWN RISK.

== Known Issues ==

I haven't figured out how to handle documentation yet. My attempts to
install the info documentation failed, and even my attempts to install
simple files like AUTHORS and THANKS have failed. I'm still somewhat new
to packaging so I still have to figure this stuff out. :P

Additionally, I'm not sure about what is considered a plugin yet, so there
are no plugin subpackages yet. I did notice a plugins.txt or something in
the source so I imagine that will help, and presumably the upstream devs
can offer the rest of the guidance. :)
